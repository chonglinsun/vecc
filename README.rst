Video Embed Code Cleaner
########################

Cleans and updates your video's embed code.

Over time, the embed codes used for videos from various providers have changed
and evolved, to make them more and more compatible with a broader set of
devices.

This is where vecc is useful: it detects the video provider and id from a given
embed code, and provides various utilities to clean this code and validate that
the video is still available.
